## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path

   ## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

   ```
   1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary

This feature delivers a classic Tic Tac Toe game as a static web app using React. A human player competes against a computer opponent with selectable Easy (random) and Hard (perfect play) difficulties. After each game, a "Play Again" button returns the user to the start screen, allowing difficulty selection and a new match. The app is fully client-side, accessible, and tested with Playwright. No backend, CI/CD, or deployment is in scope.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES2022+), React 18

**Primary Dependencies**: React, Playwright (for E2E tests)

**Storage**: N/A (all state in memory)

**Testing**: Playwright (E2E), React Testing Library (optional for unit tests)

**Target Platform**: Latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (desktop/mobile)

**Project Type**: single (static web app)

**Performance Goals**: Instant UI response; game state updates <50ms

**Constraints**: Fully client-side, no server/API, accessible via keyboard

**Scale/Scope**: Single feature, 1-2 screens, no user accounts

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle I: Code Quality and Maintainability

All code will be clear, well-structured, and documented. Tests and code reviews are required for all changes.

### Principle II: Simplicity and Minimalism

Only essential dependencies (React, Playwright) are used. No unnecessary complexity or extra libraries.

### Principle III: Modern, Accessible UI

UI will be modern and accessible. Keyboard operability is required; visible focus indicators are optional.

### Principle IV: Client-Side Only

All logic and state are handled in the browser. No backend, APIs, or server code.

### Principle V: Test-Driven Development

All features are specified and tested before implementation. Playwright covers all user flows.

### Additional Constraints

React is required. No backend, database, or deployment in scope. Must work in all modern browsers.

### Governance

Constitution version 1.0.0. Amendments require documentation and approval. Compliance reviews at milestones.

**Status:** No violations. All requirements and constraints are met by the planned approach.

```

**Structure Decision**: Single-project static web app. All source code in `src/` (components, logic, styles). Tests in `tests/` (E2E and unit). No backend or API directories.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

All critical clarifications are resolved in the spec. No open NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain. Proceed to document rationale and best practices for React Tic Tac Toe, AI move logic, and accessibility in `research.md`.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. Extract entities from feature spec → `data-model.md`:
   - Game Board: 3x3 grid, cell states, win/draw logic
   - Player: human, selects moves and difficulty
   - Computer Opponent: easy (random), hard (minimax)

2. No API contracts required (client-only app). If any internal logic contracts are needed (e.g., for AI), document as TypeScript types or interfaces in contracts/.

3. Generate contract tests for core logic (e.g., AI move selection, win/draw detection) as unit tests.

4. Extract test scenarios from user stories for E2E Playwright tests.

5. Update agent file: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` after design docs are generated.

**Output**: data-model.md, contracts/* (if needed), failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

- Tasks will be generated from the design docs (data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md) using `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`.
- Each entity and logic contract will have a corresponding test and implementation task.
- User stories will drive E2E test tasks.
- TDD: All tests are written before implementation.
- Tasks will be ordered by dependency and marked [P] for parallel execution where possible.

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations or complexity deviations. All requirements are satisfied with a single-project, client-only React app.

## Progress Tracking

*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:

- [ ] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:

- [ ] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [ ] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [ ] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)
