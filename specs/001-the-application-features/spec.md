# Feature Specification: Classic Tic Tac Toe Game

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-application-features`

**Created**: 2025-10-04

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "The application features a classic Tic Tac Toe game where a human player competes against the computer. Players can choose between an easy and a hard difficulty mode for the computer opponent, allowing for both casual and more challenging gameplay. After a game concludes, whether by win or draw, a “Play Again” button is presented, returning the user to the start screen where they can toggle the difficulty and begin a new match. The entire application is implemented as a static web app, relying solely on React for UI and logic. Comprehensive end-to-end tests executed with Playwright to ensure robust and reliable user flows. The implementation is intentionally focused and robust, following principles for high-quality software development. This project is a proof of concept. The focus is solely on the application code. CI/CD, containerization, and deployment are intentionally out of scope and not addressed for now."



## Execution Flow (main)

This feature will be developed using a spec-driven approach. Each requirement and user scenario is defined below. The implementation will follow the project constitution and be validated by UI tests.

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- Focused on user value and game experience
- No implementation details (framework is React, but not discussed here)
- All requirements are testable and unambiguous

---


## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A human player visits the web app, selects a difficulty level, and plays a game of Tic Tac Toe against the computer. After the game ends (win, lose, or draw), the player can click "Play Again" to return to the start screen, select a difficulty, and play another match.


### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the user is on the start screen, **When** they select "Easy" and start a game, **Then** the game board appears and the user plays against an easy computer opponent.
2. **Given** the user is on the start screen, **When** they select "Hard" and start a game, **Then** the game board appears and the user plays against a hard computer opponent.
3. **Given** a game is in progress, **When** the user or computer wins or the game ends in a draw, **Then** a result is shown and a "Play Again" button is presented.
4. **Given** the user clicks "Play Again", **When** the start screen appears, **Then** the user can select a difficulty and start a new game.


### Edge Cases

- What happens if the user tries to make a move after the game is over? (Move is ignored, game state does not change)
- How does the system handle rapid toggling between difficulties and starting new games? (Game state resets cleanly)
- What if the user refreshes the page mid-game? (Game resets to start screen)


## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04

- Q: What are the exact computer strategies for Easy vs Hard? → A: Easy = random valid move; Hard = perfect play (minimax, never loses)
- Q: Who takes the first move at the start of a game? → A: Human always starts
- Q: Which modern browsers must be explicitly supported and tested? → A: Latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Q: Define measurable accessibility acceptance criteria: → A: Minimum keyboard operability; focus optional



## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow a human player to play Tic Tac Toe against a computer opponent.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide two difficulty modes for the computer: Easy and Hard.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to select the difficulty before each game.
- **FR-004**: System MUST present a "Play Again" button after each game, returning the user to the start screen.
- **FR-005**: System MUST display the game result (win, lose, draw) at the end of each match.
- **FR-006**: System MUST reset all game state when starting a new game or returning to the start screen.
- **FR-007**: System MUST ignore user moves after the game is over.
- **FR-008**: System MUST be fully client-side, with no server or API calls.
- **FR-009**: System MUST be accessible and usable on all modern browsers.
- **FR-010**: System MUST be implemented as a static web app using React.
- **FR-011**: System MUST be covered by UI tests using Playwright.

- **FR-012**: In Easy mode, the computer MUST select a random valid move from the available empty cells.
- **FR-013**: In Hard mode, the computer MUST play perfectly (e.g., via minimax) such that it never loses; outcomes are win or draw only against optimal or suboptimal human play.
- **FR-014**: The human player MUST always take the first move at the start of each game.
- **FR-015**: The application MUST support and be tested on the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- **FR-016**: The application MUST be operable via keyboard for all core flows; visible focus indicators are optional.


### Key Entities

- **Game Board**: Represents the 3x3 grid, tracks cell states (empty, X, O), and determines win/draw conditions.
- **Player**: Represents the human user, can select moves and difficulty.
- **Computer Opponent**: Implements two difficulty strategies (Easy: random valid move; Hard: perfect play that never loses).
