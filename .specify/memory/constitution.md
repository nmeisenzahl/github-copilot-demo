# Tic Tac Toe React Game Constitution

## Core Principles



### I. Code Quality and Maintainability

All code MUST be clear, well-structured, and easy to maintain. Every function and component MUST be documented and tested. Code reviews are required for all changes. Rationale: High code quality ensures long-term sustainability and ease of contribution.



### II. Simplicity and Minimalism

The implementation MUST avoid unnecessary complexity. Only essential dependencies are allowed; any new dependency MUST be justified. Rationale: Simplicity reduces bugs and onboarding time.



### III. Modern, Accessible UI

The user interface MUST be modern, colorful, and accessible. All users, including those with disabilities, MUST be able to play the game. Rationale: Accessibility and modern design ensure inclusivity and engagement.



### IV. Client-Side Only

All game logic and state management MUST be handled entirely on the client side. No server code or APIs are permitted. Rationale: This constraint simplifies deployment and ensures privacy.



### V. Test-Driven Development

All features MUST be specified and tested before implementation. UI Tests (e.g., Playwright) MUST cover all user flows. Rationale: TDD ensures reliability and confidence in changes.



## Additional Constraints

- The application MUST be implemented in React.
- The game MUST be playable in all modern browsers.
- No backend, database, or serverless functions are allowed.
- CI/CD, containerization, and deployment are out of scope for this project.
- The current focus of the POC is solely on the application code.


## Development Workflow

- All features start with a written specification.
- Implementation plans MUST be created before coding.
- Tasks are generated and tracked for each feature.
- Code reviews and tests are mandatory before merging.


## Governance

The constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All PRs and reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Any complexity or deviation MUST be justified in the implementation plan. The constitution is versioned using semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Compliance reviews are expected at each major milestone.
